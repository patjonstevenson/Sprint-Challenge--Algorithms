#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Should run n times, because after adding n * n to a n times, a will be a + n * n * n because n * n * n == n * n * n


b) The for loop will run n times. The while loop will run n/2 times per run of the for loop, so what is that - (n^2)/2, so basically just O(n^2) since we ignore constants?


c) Should run O(bunnies) since it just uses recursion to iterate down from bunnies to 0, summing up the total number of bunny ears (2 per bunny).

## Exercise II

n stories infinite eggs egg thrown from floor if floor f or higher, egg breaks else, egg doesn't break

find value of f s.t. min dropped+broken

I guess I'm a little confused - are we dropping an egg off of every floor? And are we trying to minimize the number of eggs dropped (since the instructions say to minimize the number of eggs dropped + broken)?

If eggs are being dropped from every floor, couldn't we just set f to n? What is the task here? Where does the programming come in?
